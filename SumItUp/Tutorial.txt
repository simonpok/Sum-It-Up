                                                  Welcome to Sum It Up!

The objective of the game is to select the correct answer from three options before the Ball reaches the top of the screen. The Ball contains a 4-digit number, and the correct answer is the sum of its digits reduced to a single digit.

For example, if the number is 2489, the sum of its digits is 2+4+8+9 = 23, which is a two-digit number. The answer would then be 2+3 = 5.

If you select the correct answer before the ball reaches the top, your score increases by one and New 4 digit number will be generated. If you select the wrong answer or the ball reaches the top, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

Every time your score reaches a multiple of 10, the speed of the ball increases. At 10 points, the speed increases by 1x, and at 20 points, it increases by 2x and so on..

                                 Good luck and have fun playing Sum It Up!
